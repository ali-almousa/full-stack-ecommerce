  // ! I do not understand exactly the reason behind choosing one2one mapping here?
  // I believe there is a good reason for defining this mapping to be one2one even though many orders could have the same
  // address... I think since we have two columns that are mapped to the address table then one2one is safer!!!
  // ! if we delete/persist an order then delete/persist the related address. Why is this true?
  // * yes this does make a sense given that the related address only existed for the deleted/persisted order (one2one)
  // ! but why we did not apply cascade all for the other side of the relation following the same logic?
  // the shipping_address_id column is defined here (order table) and is the join column
  // the referencedColumnName is the name of the column in the other table (address table) that is being referenced
  // ! why do need to explicitly specify the referenced column name here (not like normal) while it is already
  // ! referenced in the database with the sql script? maybe if we have two columns that refer to the same table then
  // ! the referenced column should be explicitly specified!
